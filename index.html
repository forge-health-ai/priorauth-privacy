    <h1>Prior Auth Buddy — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 24, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Prior Auth Buddy ("the App") is developed by Forge Partners Inc. ("we", "us", "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and a password (stored securely via Supabase authentication).</p>
    <p><strong>Case Information:</strong> You may enter details about insurance denial cases, including procedure names, insurer names, denial reasons, and related notes. This information is stored in your account to provide the App's services.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous analytics data such as app usage patterns, feature engagement, and crash reports to improve the App.</p>

    <h2>3. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protected Health Information (PHI):</strong> The App does not collect, store, or transmit PHI as defined by HIPAA. We do not ask for or store medical records, diagnoses, treatment details, or health plan information.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Information:</strong> Payment processing for subscriptions is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store credit card numbers or payment details.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not collect your location.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> We do not access your contacts or address book.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the App's features (case tracking, appeal letter generation, call coaching)</li>
        <li>To authenticate your account</li>
        <li>To improve the App based on anonymous usage patterns</li>
        <li>To send important service-related notifications (e.g., deadline reminders, if enabled)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>The App uses artificial intelligence to generate appeal letters, analyze denial reasons, and provide coaching scripts. AI-generated content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical or legal advice. The AI processing uses your case details to generate relevant outputs but does not retain or learn from your individual data.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase infrastructure hosted in the United States. We use industry-standard encryption for data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest. Access to user data is restricted to essential service operations only.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share data only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use Supabase for database hosting and authentication, and OpenAI for AI features. These providers process data solely on our behalf.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid legal process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your case data within the App at any time.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is rated 13+ and is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information promptly.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy and, where appropriate, through in-app notification.</p>
